# LLM Integration

## Prompt Sources
- `llms.txt` is fed into all prompt calls for reference context
- Includes:
  - Training methodology
  - Lifting principles
  - Workout format standards
  - Edge cases + expected logic

## Use Cases
- **Voice Parsing:** Turn "225 for 5" into structured logs
- **Workout Suggestions:** If user says "Iâ€™m doing push today," return list of movement patterns + recommendations
- **Progress Analysis:** Generate contextual feedback on trends

## Tools
- `getUserWorkouts()`
- `getUserProgressGraph()`
- `getLiftHistory(movement: string)`

## Goals
- Build realistic plans (no fake strength jumps)
- Context-aware generation
- Integrate tools inside prompt chain
